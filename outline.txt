* System level languages

  * C and pointers were a revolution -- Finally a HIGH level language

  * C++ -- Finally a language you had to be HIGH to appreciate

  * C# -- Finally a language that goes half way to making system programming tolerable

  * C++11 -- Finally a language worthy of both +'s

  * ObjectiveC -- Like C, but without all that conjecture

* Scripting Languages

  * Bash -- I know computers are dumb but...

  * Perl -- zomg wtf does that say?

  * PHP -- zomg it does what in a function?

  * Python -- whitespace ... bah

  * Ruby -- Just.. put those statements wherever you think they look nicest

  * node.js -- No really, servers can be unintelligible and poorly defined too

* Rust for your brain

  * Rust vs...

    * C
